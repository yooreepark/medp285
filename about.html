    <h2>The game of</h2>
    <h1>Survivors</h1>
    <h2>The Unbeatable Game</h2>
      <p>How many times did you have to play to realize that this game was <b>unbeatable</b>?
      <br>Like the disappointment and frustration you may have felt playing, the game <br>
    alludes to how sexual assault survivors may feel when they are let down by our <br>
    justice system. Problems within the system only make the issue regarding sexual assault <br>
  a more pervasive issue. <br><br>

  Many survivors are often times very hesitant in reporting cases of sexual assault.<br>
    Reportedly over 80% of survivors do not report any incidents to authorities due to <br>
    fear of judgment. It is especially hard to win a case when you do not have additional<br>
    outside support. In the off chance that a case is taken to trial, which is 8%, further <br>
    problems arise. The victims have to provide a testimony of their experience, which at times <br>
    may be the only plausible piece of evidence they have. This process of trying to retrigger <br>
    memories of the incident is very traumatizing and difficult to procure. As a result, it is <br>
    inevitable for their to be discrepancies within their story from different accounts, allowing <br>
    their credibility to be undermined. If a case closes and the offender charged, alcohol makes this <br>
    entire process difficult as it can be used a mitigating to receive a lighter sentence. <br> <br>

    Survivor's logo is a teal ribbon which is used to raise awareness for rape. I was inspired to<br>
    create this website because of a recent issue in South Korea. Recently the release of a child rapist <br>
    after being in jail for 12 years has been making headlines in the country. On December 11, 2008, <br>
    Cho Doo Soon beat and raped an 8-year-old girl and was left permanently disabeled with <br>
    permanent damage to her lower abdomen. She also suffered from depression and other mental <br>
    health issues following the incident. People flew to the streets to protest his release, criticizing his <br>
    lenient sentence. Cho was supposed serve a life sentence but had it reduced after the victim <br>
    testified that the offender may have been under the influence. <br><br>

    <b>Reform begins with breaking the stigmas surrounding sexual assault which extends to all <br>
    genders, races, and ages. </b>
