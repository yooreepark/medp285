        <h1>Final Website Proposal</h1>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Survivor is a website that hopes to bring more attention to the issues sexual assault
        and the shortcomings of the justice system. Through a text-based game that you <br>
       cannot beat, it will illustrate the same way many sexual assault victims feel
     when fighting for justice. The issue in itself seems endless with no hope at times <br>
   and no matter what you try to do it is unfortunately still a threat to many of us.</p>

<h2>Full Description</h2>
<p>Recently, news of a child rapist, Cho Doo Soon, who has been released from jail after 12 years has been making headlines.
Many have been protesting his release, criticizing the leniency he received despite his heinous crimes.
Back in December 11, 2008, he brutally attacked and raped a young 8-year-old girl in a church. She was left with
permanent damage to her lower abdomen and is permanently disabled to this day. Cho who was supposed to serve a life
sentence, but had his sentence reduced based on the victim's testimony that he was supposedly under the influence. This is note
the only time alcohol has been used as a buffer for sexual assault. Another infamous case is Brock Turner, a student at
Stanford University, who sexually assaulted an unconscious 22-year-old woman. Due to the woman's state, she was not able to fully
recall the full details of the incident. Therefore, her tesitimony lost some credibility allowing Turner to manipulate
the full details. He claimed that they left a party together and the girl gave consent to the intercourse, fabricating a narrative
which did not exist. He was also reportedly under the influence, which was used to mitigate his sentence. Despite the woman
having serious head injuries as well, Turner only served 3 months in jail. It is due to there conditions that global movements like <thead>
  #metoo movement started. Since sexual assault victims are continually let down by the justice system, people have instead stood in solidarity
  fighting for justice for those who are marginalized in marginalized communities. With so many loopholes in the justice system, when innocent peopel
  become victims to sexual assault, it seems like an unwinnable battle. This is one reason why many people stay silent on the matter for a long time, even years.
  There is also a strong stigma surrounding the issue which makes it even more difficult to be vocal about something so important and relevant.
  There needs to be an increase in public discourse on this matter because sexual assault comes in many way and forms, and it is not always something
  one is able to recognize right away. It is frustrating and scary because no matter how safe or precautious one is, they are still vulnerable in becoming a victim.
  That is why I decided to create a text based game with different scenarios, allowing the player to make their own choices. Depending on their choices, the narrative
  will develop in different ways and there will be varied outcomes. However, the main point of this game is that it is unbeatable. Among all of the different choices,
  there is no way to win. I think this is a good way of illustrating how complicated this issue is. No matter how many times one tries to repeat a scenario by making
  different decisions, they will always lose. Sometimes it will never be enough to be safe or cautious of what one does or how they act. It is therefore something
  the government has to fully intervene in more. I will keep the color palette monotonous to evoke the severity of the issue and to communicate a serious and informative
  tone. I think it is a nice juxtaposition to something as lighthearted like a game. There will be a variety of different scenarios in the game to, once again,
  illustrate that sexual assault does not have a single identity. The logo that I will use is a teal ribbon, which is used to raise awaremess for sexual assault victims.
  As well as the game, I will have another page simply that simply informs the audience on the predicaments and issues. Overall, I am aiming to make it as engaging as possible.
