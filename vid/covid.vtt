1
00:04.450 --> 00:09.000
Being confined at home due to Covid-19 made me miss traveling.

2
00:10.010 --> 00:14.000
I especially missed traveling in Asia, which I did last year with my friends.

3
00:14.700 --> 00:17.350
I was reminded me of all the spectacular sights and amazing food I experienced there.

4
00:18.500 --> 00:21.500
Despite being there for a month, we always managed to find something to do each day.

5
00:22.300 --> 00:27.200
Some days were challenging and exciting,

6
00:28.500 --> 00:31.750
While some days were relaxing and healing.

7
00:32.850 --> 00:34.950
Looking back on my trip I can't help but wonder,

8
00:35.500 --> 00:38.600
What new experiences I'll have when I go back after this pandemic.

9
00:39.500 --> 00:42.000
Hopefully it'll be a place

10
00:43.300 --> 00:44.800
Where I can return with my friends again,

11
00:46.300 --> 00:49.700
And feel that things have finally returned back to normal.
